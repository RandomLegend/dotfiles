# Welcome...So this will be messy ü§ó

## ‚ùóBear in mind that i have a 3440x1440 display..so this is for that configuration‚ùó

### What programs i use ‚öôÔ∏è
|What does it do?   | Name?   |Link   |
|---|---|---|
| Tiling Window Manager  | KDE Bismuth   | https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth  |
| Compositor  | Picom  | https://github.com/Arian8j2/picom  |
| Dock  | Polybar  | https://github.com/polybar/polybar  |
| Dock  | Latte-Dock  | https://invent.kde.org/plasma/latte-dock   |

### Let's start with Colors üåà

|For?| Link |
|---|---|
| KDE   | https://github.com/Smart-Helper/dotfiles/tree/main/local/share/color-schemes |

### Now comes the Themes üñåÔ∏è

|For?| Link |
|---|---|
| KVantum   | https://github.com/catppuccin/Kvantum |
| GTK  | https://store.kde.org/p/1715554 |
| Rofi  | https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi |

Those Themes are the ones i based my dotfiles on...So when you want what i have (what you basically came here for) use the following.

### And my specific .config files üìë are all up there to find. 

### For Rofi i used the only available launchers that i left in the config. For the Applauncher it's Type-6 / Style-1. And for the Powermenu it's  Type-1 / Style-2. However i had to hardcode the colorvalues for the applauncher in the style-1.rasi file to kinda match my catppuccin theme.

## I hope i didn't forget anything that you saw in my post...if yes and you want something specific you can just contact me either here or on reddit and i give you what you crave.
